        <h3>Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            This site stores little to no data on you. Any logs kept are purely for diagnostic purposes, and I probably don't know how to read them. (This is professionally know as: Privacy through intentional incompetence.) This site does use some cloudflare servies. If you don't like that, I reccomend you use tor.
            
            As for cookies, you might need them for auth0 (the login provider), so you may want to check you their tos, etc.

            Note, we only collect the data you provide, e.g anything auth0 requests. We will retain this forever, or until I loose it or you ask me to delete it.

            Thats it. 
        </p>

        <h3>TOS</h2>
        <p>
            Don't do anything illegal.
            auth0 and cloudflare tos apply.
            If you do do anything illegal, it's your problem. Ok? Leave me out of this.
            But just to repeat, please don't do anything illegal. (please)
            If you find a vunerability, please report it to me. I have no money, but my gratitude will be etarnal.
            Also please don't compormise the site in any way.
            Merci!
        </p>
